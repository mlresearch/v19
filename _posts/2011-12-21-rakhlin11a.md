title: 'Online Learning: Beyond Regret'
abstract: 'We study online learnability of a wide class of problems, extending the
  results of Rakhlin et al. (2010a) to general notions of performance measure well beyond
  external regret. Our framework simultaneously captures such well-known notions as
  internal and general $\Phi$-regret, learning with non-additive global cost functions,
  Blackwell’s approachability, calibration of forecasters, and more. We show that
  learnability in all these situations is due to control of the same three quantities:
  a martingale convergence term, a term describing the ability to perform well if
  future is known, and  a generalization of sequential Rademacher complexity, studied
  in Rakhlin et al. (2010a). Since we directly study complexity of the problem instead of
  focusing on efficient algorithms, we are able to improve and extend many known results
  which have been previously derived via an algorithmic construction.'
