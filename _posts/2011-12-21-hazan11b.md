title: A simple multi-armed bandit algorithm with optimal variation-bounded regret
abstract: We pose the question of whether it is possible to design a simple, linear-time
  algorithm for the basic multi-armed bandit problem in the adversarial setting which
  has a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{Q \log T})$, where $Q$ is the total quadratic variation
  of all the arms.
