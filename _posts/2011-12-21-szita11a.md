title: Agnostic KWIK learning and efficient approximate reinforcement learning
abstract: A popular approach in reinforcement learning is to use a model-based algorithm,
  i.e., an algorithm that utilizes a model learner to learn an approximate model to
  the  environment.It has been shown that  such a model-based learner is efficient  if
  the model learner is efficient  in the so-called “knows what it knows”  (KWIK)  framework.A
  major limitation of the standard KWIK framework is that, by its very definition,
  it covers only the case when the (model) learner can represent  the actual environment
  with no errors.In this paper, we study the agnostic KWIK learning model, where we
  relax this assumption by allowing nonzero approximation errors. We show that with
  the new definition  an efficient model learner still leads to an efficient reinforcement
  learning algorithm.At the same time, though, we find that learning within the new
  framework can be substantially slower as compared to the standard framework, even
  in the case of simple learning problems.
