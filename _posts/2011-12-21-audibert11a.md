title: Minimax Policies for Combinatorial Prediction Games
abstract: 'We address the online linear optimization problem when theactions of the
  forecaster are represented by binary vectors.Our goal is to understand the magnitude
  of the minimax regretfor the worst possible set of actions. We study the problemunder
  three different assumptions for the feedback: full information, and the partial
  information models of theso-called ``semi-bandit'''', and ``bandit'''' problems.
  We consider both $L_\infty$-, and $L_2$-type of restrictions forthe losses assigned
  by the adversary.We formulate a general strategy using Bregman projections on top
  of a potential-based gradient descent, which  generalizes the ones studied in the
  series of papers \cite{GLLO07, DHK08, AHR08, CL09, HW09, KWK10, UNK10, KRS10} and
  \cite{AB10}. We provide simpleproofs that recover most of the previous results.
  We propose new upper bounds for the semi-bandit game. Moreover we derive lower bounds
  for all three feedback assumptions. With the only exception of the bandit game,
  the upper and lower boundsare tight, up to a constant factor.Finally, we answer
  a question asked by \cite{KWK10} by showing that the exponentially weighted average
  forecaster is suboptimal against $L_{\infty}$ adversaries.'
