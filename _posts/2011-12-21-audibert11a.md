title: Minimax Policies for Combinatorial Prediction Games
abstract: |
  We address the online linear optimization problem when the actions of
  the forecaster are represented by binary vectors. Our goal is to
  understand the magnitude of the minimax regret for the worst possible
  set of actions. We study the problem under three different
  assumptions for the feedback: full information, and the partial
  information models of the so-called “semi-bandit”, and “bandit”
  problems. We consider both $L_\infty$, and $L_2$-type of
  restrictions for the losses assigned by the adversary. We formulate a
  general strategy using Bregman projections on top of a
  potential-based gradient descent, which generalizes the ones studied
  in the series of papers Gyorgy et al. (2007); Dani et al. (2008);
  Abernethy et al. (2008); Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2009); Helmbold
  and Warmuth (2009); Koolen et al. (2010); Uchiya et al. (2010); Kale
  et al. (2010) and Audibert and Bubeck (2010). We provide simple
  proofs that recover most of the previous results. We propose new
  upper bounds for the semi-bandit game. Moreover we derive lower
  bounds for all three feedback assumptions. With the only exception
  of the bandit game, the upper and lower bounds are tight, up to a
  constant factor. Finally, we answer a question asked by Koolen et
  al. (2010) by showing that the exponentially weighted average
  forecaster is suboptimal against $L_\infty$ adversaries.
