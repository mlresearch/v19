title: Minimax Policies for Combinatorial Prediction Games
abstract: 'We address the online linear optimization problem when theactions of the
  forecaster are represented by binary vectors.Our goal is to understand the magnitude
  of the minimax regretfor the worst possible set of actions. We study the problemunder
  three different assumptions for the feedback: full information, and the partial
  information models of theso-called “semi-bandit”, and “bandit” problems. We consider
  both L_∞-, and L_2-type of restrictions forthe losses assigned by the adversary.We
  formulate a general strategy using Bregman projections on top of a potential-based
  gradient descent, which  generalizes the ones studied in the series of papers \citeGLLO07,
  DHK08, AHR08, CL09, HW09, KWK10, UNK10, KRS10 and \citeAB10. We provide simpleproofs
  that recover most of the previous results. We propose new upper bounds for the semi-bandit
  game. Moreover we derive lower bounds for all three feedback assumptions. With the
  only exception of the bandit game, the upper and lower boundsare tight, up to a
  constant factor.Finally, we answer a question asked by \citeKWK10 by showing that
  the exponentially weighted average forecaster is suboptimal against L_∞ adversaries.'
