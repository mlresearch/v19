title: Sample Complexity Bounds for Differentially Private Learning
abstract: 'This work studies the problem of privacy-preserving classification -- namely,
  learning a classifier from sensitive data while preserving the privacy ofindividuals
  in the training set.In particular, the learning algorithm is required in this problem
  toguarantee differential privacy, a very strong notion of privacy that hasgained
  significant attention in recent years.A natural question to ask is: what is the
  sample requirement of a learningalgorithm that guarantees a certain level of privacy
  and accuracy?We address this question in the context of learning with infinite hypothesis
  classes whenthe data is drawn from a continuous distribution.We first show that
  even for very simple hypothesis classes, any algorithmthat uses a finite number
  of examples and guarantees differential privacymust fail to return an accurate classifier
  for at least some unlabeled datadistributions.This result is unlike the case with
  either finite hypothesis classes ordiscrete data domains, in which distribution-free
  private learning ispossible, as previously shown by \citet{KLNRS08}.We then consider
  two approaches to differentially private learning that get around this lower bound.The
  first approach is to use prior knowledge about the unlabeled data distribution in
  the form of a reference distribution $\U$ chosen independently of the sensitive
  data. Given such a reference $\U$, we provide an upper bound on the sample requirement
  that depends (among other things) on a measure of closenessbetween $\U$ and the
  unlabeled data distribution. Our upper bound appliesto the non-realizable as well
  as the realizable case. The second approachis to relax the privacy requirement,
  by requiring only label-privacy --namely, that the only labels (and not the unlabeled
  parts of the examples)be considered sensitive information. An upper bound on the
  samplerequirement of learning with label privacy was shown by \citet{CDKMT06}; inthis
  work, we show a lower bound.'
