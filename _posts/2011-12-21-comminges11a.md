title: Tight conditions for consistent variable selection in high dimensional nonparametric
  regression
abstract: We address the issue of variable selection in the regression model with
  very high ambient dimension, \textit{i.e.}, when the number of covariates is very
  large. The main focus is on the situation where the number of relevant covariates,
  called intrinsic dimension, is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Without
  assuming any parametric form of the underlying regression function, we get tight
  conditions making it possible to consistently estimate the set of relevant variables.
  These conditions relate the intrinsic dimension to the ambient dimension and to
  the sample size.  The procedure that is provably consistent under these tight conditions
  is simple and is based on comparing the empirical Fourier coefficients with an appropriately
  chosen threshold value.
