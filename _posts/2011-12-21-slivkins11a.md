title: Contextual Bandits with Similarity Information
abstract: In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, an online algorithm makes a sequence
  of choices. In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and
  receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy
  sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems
  with exponentially or infinitely large  strategy sets, where one needs to assume
  extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature
  considered information on similarity between arms.We consider similarity information
  in the setting of \emph{contextual bandits}, a natural extension of the basic MAB
  problem where before each round an algorithm is given the \emph{context} -- a hint
  about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing
  advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly
  simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting
  is via a \emph{similarity distance} between the context-arm pairs which bounds from
  above the difference between the respective expected payoffs.Prior work on contextual
  bandits with similarity uses ``uniform'' partitions of the similarity space, so
  that each context-arm pair is approximated by the closest pair in the partition.
  Algorithms based on ``uniform'' partitions disregard the structure of the payoffs
  and the context arrivals, which is potentially wasteful. We present algorithms that
  are based on {\em adaptive} partitions, and take advantage of ``benign'' payoffs
  and context arrivals without sacrificing the worst-case performance. The central
  idea is to maintain a finer partition in high-payoff regions of the similarity space
  and in popular regions of the context space. Our results apply to several other
  settings, e.g. MAB with constrained temporal change~\citep{DynamicMAB-colt08} and
  sleeping bandits~\citep{sleeping-colt08}.
