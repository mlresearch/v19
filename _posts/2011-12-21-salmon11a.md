title: Optimal aggregation of affine estimators
abstract: We consider  the problem of combining  a (possibly uncountably infinite)
  set of affine estimators innon-parametric regression model with heteroscedastic
  Gaussian noise. Focusing on the exponentially weighted aggregate,  we prove a PAC-Bayesian
  type inequality that leadsto sharp oracle inequalities in discrete but also in continuous
  settings. The framework is general enough to cover the combinations of various procedures
  such asleast square regression, kernel ridge regression, shrinking estimators and
  many other estimators used in the literature on statistical inverse problems. As
  aconsequence, we show that the proposed aggregateprovides an adaptive estimator
  in the exact minimax sense without neither discretizing the range of tuningparameters
  nor splitting the set of observations. We also illustrate numerically the good performance
  achievedby the exponentially weighted aggregate.
