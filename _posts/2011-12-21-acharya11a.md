title: Competitive Closeness Testing
abstract: We test whether two sequences are generated by the same distributionor by
  two different ones.Unlike previous work, we make no assumptions on the distributions'support
  size. Additionally, we compare our performance to thatof the best possible test.We
  describe an efficiently-computable algorithm based on\emph{pattern} maximum likelihood
  that is near optimal whenever the bestpossible error probability is $\le\exp(-14n^{2/3})$using
  length-$n$ sequences.
