title: Competitive Closeness Testing
abstract: We test whether two sequences are generated by the same distributionor by
  two different ones.Unlike previous work, we make no assumptions on the distributionsâ€™support
  size. Additionally, we compare our performance to thatof the best possible test.We
  describe an efficiently-computable algorithm based on\emphpattern maximum likelihood
  that is near optimal whenever the bestpossible error probability is \le\exp(-14n^2/3)using
  length-n sequences.
