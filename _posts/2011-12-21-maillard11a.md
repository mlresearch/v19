title: A Finite-Time Analysis of Multi-armed Bandits Problems with Kullback-Leibler
  Divergences
abstract: We consider a Kullback-Leibler-based algorithm for the stochastic multi-armed
  bandit problem in the case of distributions with finite supports (not necessarily
  known beforehand), whose asymptotic regret matches the lower bound of Burnetas and Katehakis (1996).
  Our contribution is to provide a finite-time analysis of this algorithm; we get bounds
  whose main terms are smaller than the ones of previously known algorithms with finite-time
  analyses (like UCB-type algorithms).
