title: A Finite-Time Analysis of Multi-armed Bandits Problems with Kullback-Leibler
  Divergences
abstract: We consider a Kullback-Leibler-based algorithm for the stochastic multi-armed
  bandit problem in the case of distributions with finite supports(not necessarily
  known beforehand), whose asymptotic regret matches the lower bound of \citet{Burnetas96}.
  Our contribution is to provide a finite-time analysis of this algorithm;we get bounds
  whose main terms are smaller than the ones of previously known algorithms with finite-time
  analyses (like UCB-type algorithms).
