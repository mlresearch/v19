title: Mixability is Bayes Risk Curvature Relative to Log Loss
abstract: "Mixability of a loss governs the best possible performance when\taggregating
  expert predictions with respect to that loss. The\tdetermination of the mixability
  constant for binary losses is\tstraightforward but opaque. In the binary case we
  make this \ttransparent and simpler by\tcharacterising mixability in terms of the
  second derivative of the\tBayes risk of proper losses.  We then extend this result
  to\tmulticlass proper losses where there are few existing results.  We\tshow that
  mixability is governed by the Hessian of the Bayes risk,\trelative to the Hessian
  of the Bayes risk for log loss. We\tconclude by comparing our result to other work
  that bounds\tprediction performance in terms of the geometry of the Bayes risk.\tAlthough
  all calculations are for proper losses, we also show how\tto carry the results across
  to improper losses."
