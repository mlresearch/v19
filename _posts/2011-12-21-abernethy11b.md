title: Blackwell Approachability and No-Regret Learning are Equivalent
abstract: 'We consider the celebrated Blackwell Approachability Theorem for two-player
  games with vector payoffs. Blackwell himself previously showed that the theorem
  implies the existence of a ``no-regret'''' algorithm for a simple online learning
  problem. We show that this relationship is in fact much stronger, that Blackwell''s
  result is equivalent to, in a very strong sense, the problem of regret minimization
  for Online Linear Optimization. We show that any algorithm for one such problem
  can be efficiently converted into an algorithm for the other. We provide one novel
  application of this reduction: the first \emph{efficient} algorithm for calibrated
  forecasting.'
