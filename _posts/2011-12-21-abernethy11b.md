title: Blackwell Approachability and No-Regret Learning are Equivalent
abstract: 'We consider the celebrated Blackwell Approachability Theorem for two-player
  games with vector payoffs. Blackwell himself previously showed that the theorem
  implies the existence of a “no-regret” algorithm for a simple online learning problem.
  We show that this relationship is in fact much stronger, that Blackwell’s result
  is equivalent to, in a very strong sense, the problem of regret minimization for
  Online Linear Optimization. We show that any algorithm for one such problem can
  be efficiently converted into an algorithm for the other. We provide one novel application
  of this reduction: the first \emphefficient algorithm for calibrated forecasting.'
