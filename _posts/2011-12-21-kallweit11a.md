title: A Close Look to Margin Complexity and Related Parameters
abstract: Concept classes can canonically be represented by sign-matrices,i.e., by
  matrices with entries 1 and -1. The question whethera sign-matrix (concept class)
  A can be learned by a machine that performs large margin classification is closely
  related to the“margin complexity” associated with A. We consider severalvariants
  of margin complexity, reveal how they are relatedto each other, and we reveal how
  they are related to other notions of learning-theoretic relevance like SQ-dimension,
  CSQ-dimension,and the Forster bound.
