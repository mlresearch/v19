title: 'Collaborative Filtering with the Trace Norm: Learning, Bounding, and Transducing'
abstract: Trace-norm regularization is a widely-used and successful approach for collaborative
  filtering and matrix completion. However, its theoretical understanding is surprisingly
  weak, and despite previous attempts, there are no distribution-free, non-trivial
  learning guarantees currently known. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing
  such guarantees, under mild assumptions which correspond to collaborative filtering
  as performed in practice. In fact, we claim that previous difficulties partially
  stemmed from a mismatch betweenthe standard learning-theoretic modeling of collaborative
  filtering, and its practical application. Our results also shed some light on the
  issue of collaborative filtering with bounded models, which enforce predictions
  to lie within a certain range. In particular, we provide experimental and theoretical
  evidence that such models lead to a modest yet significant improvement.
