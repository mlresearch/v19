title: Maximum Likelihood vs. Sequential Normalized Maximum Likelihood  in On-line
  Density Estimation
abstract: The paper considers sequential prediction of individual sequences  with
  log loss (online density estimation) using an exponential  family of distributions.
  We first analyze the regret of the maximum  likelihood (“follow the leader”) strategy.
  We find that this  strategy is (1) suboptimal and (2) requires an additional assumption  about
  boundedness of the data sequence. We then show that both  problems can be be addressed
  by adding the currently predicted  outcome to the calculation of the maximum likelihood,
  followed by  normalization of the distribution.  The strategy obtained in this  way
  is known in the literature as the \emphsequential normalized    maximum likelihood
  or \emphlast-step minimax strategy. We show  for the first time that for general
  exponential families, the regret  is bounded by the familiar (k/2) \log n and thus
  optimal up to  O(1).  We also show the relationship to the Bayes strategy with  Jeffreys’
  prior.
