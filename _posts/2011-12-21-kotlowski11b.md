title: Minimax Algorithm for Learning Rotations
abstract: It is unknown what is the most suitable regularization for rotation matrices
  and how to maintain uncertainty overrotations in an online setting.We propose to
  address these questions by studying the minimax algorithm for rotations and begin
  by working out the 2-dimensional case.
