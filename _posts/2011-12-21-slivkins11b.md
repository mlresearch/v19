title: Monotone multi-armed bandit allocations
abstract: We present a novel angle for multi-armed bandits (henceforth abbreviated
  MAB) which follows from the recent work on \emphMAB mechanisms \citepMechMAB-ec09,DevanurK08,Transform-ec10.
  The new problem is, essentially, about designing MAB algorithms under an additional
  constraint motivated by their application to MAB mechanisms.This note is self-contained,
  although some familiarity with MAB is assumed; we refer the reader to \citeCesaBL-book
  for more background.
