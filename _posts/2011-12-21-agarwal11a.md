title: Oracle inequalities for computationally budgeted model selection
abstract: We analyze general model selection procedures using penalized  empirical
  loss minimization under computational constraints. While  classical model selection
  approaches do not consider computational  aspects of performing model selection,
  we argue that any practical  model selection procedure must not only trade off estimation
  and  approximation error, but also the effects of the computational  effort required
  to compute empirical minimizers for different  function classes. We provide a framework
  for analyzing such  problems, and we give algorithms for model selection under a  computational
  budget. These algorithms satisfy oracle inequalities  that show that the risk of
  the selected model is not much worse than  if we had devoted all of our computational
  budget to the best  function class.
