title: Complexity-Based Approach to Calibration with Checking Rules
abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting a sequence of outcomes from an unknown
  source. The quality of the forecaster is measured by a family of checking rules.
  We prove upper bounds on the value of the associated game, thus certifying the existence
  of a calibrated strategy for the forecaster. We show that complexity of the family
  of checking rules can be captured by the notion of a sequential cover introduced
  in \citepRakSriTew10a. Various natural assumptions on the class of checking rules
  are considered, including finiteness of Vapnik-Chervonenkis and Littlestoneâ€™s dimensions.
