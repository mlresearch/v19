title: Lower Bounds and Hardness Amplification for Learning Shallow Monotone Formulas
abstract: Much work has been done on learning various classes of “simple" monotone
  functions under the uniform distribution. In this paper we give the first unconditional
  lower bounds for learning problems of this sort by showing that polynomial-time algorithms
  cannot learn shallow monotone Boolean formulas under the uniform distribution in the
  well-studied Statistical Query (SQ) model. We introduce a new approach to understanding
  the learnability of “simple” monotone functions that is based on a recent characterization
  of Strong SQ learnability by Simon (2007). Using the characterization we first
  show that depth-3 monotone formulas of size $n^{o(1)}$ cannot be learned by any polynomial-time
  SQ algorithm to accuracy $1 - 1/(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$.  We then build on this result to show
  that depth-4 monotone formulas of size $n^{o(1)}$ cannot be learned even to a certain
  $\frac 1 2 + o(1)$ accuracy in polynomial time.  This improved hardness is achieved
  using a general technique that we introduce for amplifying the hardness of “mildly
  hard” learning problems in either the PAC or SQ framework. Thi shardness amplification
  for learning builds on the ideas in the work of O’Donnell (2004) on hardness amplification
  for approximating functions using small circuits, and is applicable to a number of
  other contexts. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can also be used to reduce
  the well-known open problem of learning juntas to learning of depth-3 monotone formulas.
