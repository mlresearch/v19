title: A New Algorithm for Compressed Counting with Applications in Shannon Entropy
  Estimation in Dynamic Data
abstract: Efficient estimation of the moments and Shannon entropy of data streams
  is an important task in modern machine learning and data mining.  To estimate the
  Shannon entropy, it suffices to accurately estimate the $\alpha$-th  moment with
  $\Delta = |1-\alpha|\approx0$. To guarantee that the error of estimated Shannon
  entropy is within a $\nu$-additive factor, the method of {\em symmetric stable random
  projections} requires $O\left(\frac{1}{\nu^2\Delta^2}\right)$ samples, which is
  extremely expensive. The first paper~\citep{Proc:Li_SODA09} in {\em Compressed Counting
  (CC)}, based on {\em skewed-stable random projections}, supplies a substantial improvement
  by reducing the sample complexity to $O\left(\frac{1}{\nu^2\Delta}\right)$, which
  is still  expensive. The followup work~\citep{Proc:Li_UAI09} provides a  practical
  algorithm, which is however  difficult to analyze theoretically.In this paper, we
  propose a new   accurate algorithm for Compressed Counting, whose sample complexity
  is only $O\left(\frac{1}{\nu^2}\right)$ for $\nu$-additive Shannon entropy estimation.
  The constant factor for this bound is merely about 6.  In addition, we prove that
  our algorithm achieves an upper bound of the Fisher information and in fact it is  close
  to $100\%$  statistically optimal.  An empirical study is  conducted to verify the
  accuracy of our algorithm.
