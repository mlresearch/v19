title: A New Algorithm for Compressed Counting with Applications in Shannon Entropy
  Estimation in Dynamic Data
abstract: Efficient estimation of the moments and Shannon entropy of data streams
  is an important task in modern machine learning and data mining.  To estimate the
  Shannon entropy, it suffices to accurately estimate the α-th  moment with ∆= |1-α|\approx0.
  To guarantee that the error of estimated Shannon entropy is within a ν-additive
  factor, the method of \em symmetric stable random projections requires O\left(\frac1ν^2∆^2\right)
  samples, which is extremely expensive. The first paper \citepProc:Li_SODA09 in \em
  Compressed Counting (CC), based on \em skewed-stable random projections, supplies
  a substantial improvement by reducing the sample complexity to O\left(\frac1ν^2∆\right),
  which is still  expensive. The followup work \citepProc:Li_UAI09 provides a  practical
  algorithm, which is however  difficult to analyze theoretically.In this paper, we
  propose a new   accurate algorithm for Compressed Counting, whose sample complexity
  is only O\left(\frac1ν^2\right) for ν-additive Shannon entropy estimation. The constant
  factor for this bound is merely about 6.  In addition, we prove that our algorithm
  achieves an upper bound of the Fisher information and in fact it is  close to 100%  statistically
  optimal.  An empirical study is  conducted to verify the accuracy of our algorithm.
