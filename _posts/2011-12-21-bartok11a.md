title: Minimax Regret of Finite Partial-Monitoring Games in Stochastic Environments
abstract: In a partial monitoring game, the learner repeatedly chooses an action,
  the environment responds with an outcome, and then the learner suffers a loss and receives
  a feedback signal, both of which are fixed functions of the action and the outcome.
  The goal of the learner is to minimize his regret, which is the difference between
  his total cumulative loss and the total loss of the best fixed action in hindsight. Assuming
  that the outcomes are generated in an i.i.d. fashion from an arbitrary and unknown
  probability distribution, we characterize the minimax regret of any partial monitoring
  game with finitely many actions and outcomes. It turns out that the minimax regret
  of any such game is either zero, $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T}), \Theta(T^{2/3})$, or $\Theta(T)$. We provide
  a computationally efficient learning algorithm that achieves the minimax regret within
  logarithmic factor for any game.
