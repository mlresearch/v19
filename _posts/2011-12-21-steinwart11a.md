title: Adaptive Density Level Set Clustering
abstract: Clusters are often defined to be the connected components of a density level
  set.Unfortunately, this definition depends on a level that needs to be user specifiedby
  some means. In this paper we present a simple algorithm that is able to asymptotically
  determinethe optimal level, that is, the level at which there is the first split
  in the cluster treeof the data generating distribution. We further show that this
  algorithm asymptotically recoversthe corresponding connected components. Unlike
  previous work, our analysis does not require strong assumptions on the density such
  as continuity or even smoothness.
