title: Sequential Event Prediction with Association Rules
abstract: We consider a supervised learning problem in which data are revealed sequentially
  and the goal is to determine what will next be revealed. In the context of this
  problem, algorithms based on association rules have a distinct advantage over classical
  statistical and machine learning methods; however, there has not previously been
  a theoretical foundation established for using association rules in supervised learning.
  We present two simple algorithms that incorporate association rules, and provide
  generalization guarantees on these algorithms based on algorithmic stability analysis
  from statistical learning theory. We include a discussion of the strict minimum
  support threshold often used in association rule mining, and introduce an “adjusted
  confidence” measure that provides a weaker minimum support condition that has advantages
  over the strict minimum support. The paper brings together ideas from statistical
  learning theory, association rule mining and Bayesian analysis.
