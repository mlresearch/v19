title: Robust approachability and regret minimization in games with partial monitoring
abstract: Approachability has become a standard tool in analyzing learning algorithms
  in the adversarial online learning setup.We develop a variant of approachability
  for games where there is ambiguity in the obtained reward that belongs to a set,
  rather than being a single vector. Using this variant we tackle the problem of approachability
  in games with partial monitoring and develop simple and efficientalgorithms (i.e.,
  with constant per-step complexity) for this setup.We finally consider external and
  internal regret in repeated games with partial monitoring, for which we deriveregret-minimizing
  strategies based on approachability theory.
