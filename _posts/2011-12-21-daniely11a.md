title: Multiclass Learnability and the ERM principle
abstract: 'Multiclass learning is an area of growing practical relevance, for which
  the currently available theory is still far from providing satisfactory understanding.  We
  study the learnability of multiclass prediction, and derive upper and lower bounds
  on the sample complexity of multiclass hypothesis classes in different learning models:
  batch/online, realizable/unrealizable,full information/bandit feedback.  Our analysis
  reveals a surprising phenomenon: In the multiclass setting, in sharp contrast to
  binary classification, not all Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithms are equally
  successful. We show that there exist hypotheses classes for which some ERM learners
  have lower sample complexity than others. Furthermore, there are classes that are
  learnable by some ERM learners, while other ERM learner will fail to learn them.
  We propose a principle for designing good ERM learners, and use this principle to
  prove tight bounds on the sample complexity of learning symmetric multiclass
  hypothesis classes (that is, classes that are invariant under any permutation of
  label names). We demonstrate the relevance of the theory by analyzing the sample
  complexity of two widely used hypothesis classes: generalized linear multiclass models
  and reduction trees. We also obtain some practically relevant conclusions.'
