title: Neyman-Pearson classification under a strict constraint
abstract: 'Motivated by problems of anomaly detection, this paper implements the Neyman-Pearson
  paradigm to deal with asymmetric errors in binary classification with a convex loss.
  Given a finite collection of classifiers, we combine them and obtain a new classifier  that
  satisfies simultaneously the two following properties with high probability: (i),
  its probability of type I error is below a pre-specified level and (ii), it has
  probability of type  II error close to the minimum possible. The proposed classifier
  is obtained by minimizing an empirical objective subject to an empirical constraint.
  The novelty of the method is that the classifier output by this problem is shown
  to satisfy the original constraint on type I error. This strict enforcement of the
  constraint has interesting consequences on the control of the type II error and
  we develop new techniques to handle this situation.  Finally, connections with chance
  constrained optimization are evident and are investigated.'
