title: Concentration-Based Guarantees  for Low-Rank Matrix Reconstruction
abstract: We consider the problem of approximately reconstructing a partially-observed,   approximately
  low-rank matrix.  This problem has received much  attention lately, mostly using
  the trace-norm as a surrogate to the  rank.  Here we study low-rank matrix reconstruction
  using both the  trace-norm, as well as the less-studied max-norm, and present  reconstruction
  guarantees based on existing analysis on the  Rademacher complexity of the unit
  balls of these norms. We show how  these are superior in several ways to recently
  published guarantees  based on specialized analysis.
