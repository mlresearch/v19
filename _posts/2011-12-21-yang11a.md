title: Identifiability of Priors from Bounded Sample Sizes  with Applications to Transfer
  Learning
abstract: We explore a transfer learning setting, in which a finite sequence of target
  concepts are sampled independently with an unknown distribution from a known family.We
  study the total number of labeled examples required to learn all targets to an arbitrary
  specified expected accuracy, focusing on the asymptotics in the number of tasks
  and the desired accuracy.  Our primary interest is formally understanding the fundamental
  benefits of transfer learning, compared to learning each target independently from
  the others.Our approach to the transfer problem is general, in the sense that it
  can be used with a variety of learning protocols.  The key insight driving our approach
  is that the distribution of the target concepts is identifiable from the joint distribution
  over a number of random labeled data points equal the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension
  of the concept space.  This is not necessarily the case for the joint distribution
  over any smaller number of points.This work has particularly interesting implications
  when applied to active learning methods.
