title: Does an Efficient Calibrated Forecasting Strategy Exist?
abstract: 'We recall two previously-proposed notions of \emphasymptotic calibration
  for a forecaster making a sequence of probability predictions. We note that the
  existence of efficient algorithms for calibrated forecasting holds only in the case
  of binary outcomes. We pose the question: do there exist such efficient algorithms
  for the general (non-binary) case?'
