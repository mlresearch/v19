<h3>Abstract</h3>
We recall two previously-proposed notions of \emph{asymptotic calibration} for a forecaster making a sequence of probability predictions. We note that the existence of efficient algorithms for calibrated forecasting holds only in the case of binary outcomes. We pose the question: do there exist such efficient algorithms for the general (non-binary) case?
