<h2>A Close Look to Margin Complexity and Related Parameters</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
Concept classes can canonically be represented by sign-matrices,i.e., by matrices with entries $1$ and $-1$. The question whethera sign-matrix (concept class) $A$ can be learned by a machine that performs large margin classification is closely related to the``margin complexity'' associated with $A$. We consider severalvariants of margin complexity, reveal how they are relatedto each other, and we reveal how they are related to other notions of learning-theoretic relevance like SQ-dimension, CSQ-dimension,and the Forster bound.
