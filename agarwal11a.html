<h3>Abstract</h3>
We analyze general model selection procedures using penalized  empirical loss minimization under computational constraints. While  classical model selection approaches do not consider computational  aspects of performing model selection, we argue that any practical  model selection procedure must not only trade off estimation and  approximation error, but also the effects of the computational  effort required to compute empirical minimizers for different  function classes. We provide a framework for analyzing such  problems, and we give algorithms for model selection under a  computational budget. These algorithms satisfy oracle inequalities  that show that the risk of the selected model is not much worse than  if we had devoted all of our computational budget to the best  function class.
