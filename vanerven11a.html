<h3>Abstract</h3>
Mixability of a loss governs the best possible performance when	aggregating expert predictions with respect to that loss. The	determination of the mixability constant for binary losses is	straightforward but opaque. In the binary case we make this 	transparent and simpler by	characterising mixability in terms of the second derivative of the	Bayes risk of proper losses.  We then extend this result to	multiclass proper losses where there are few existing results.  We	show that mixability is governed by the Hessian of the Bayes risk,	relative to the Hessian of the Bayes risk for log loss. We	conclude by comparing our result to other work that bounds	prediction performance in terms of the geometry of the Bayes risk.	Although all calculations are for proper losses, we also show how	to carry the results across to improper losses.
