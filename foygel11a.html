<h2>Concentration-Based Guarantees  for Low-Rank Matrix Reconstruction</h2>
<p><i><b>Rina Foygel, Nathan Srebro</b></i> ; JMLR W&amp;CP 19:315-340, 2011.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
We consider the problem of approximately reconstructing a partially-observed,   approximately low-rank matrix.  This problem has received much  attention lately, mostly using the trace-norm as a surrogate to the  rank.  Here we study low-rank matrix reconstruction using both the  trace-norm, as well as the less-studied max-norm, and present  reconstruction guarantees based on existing analysis on the  Rademacher complexity of the unit balls of these norms. We show how  these are superior in several ways to recently published guarantees  based on specialized analysis.
